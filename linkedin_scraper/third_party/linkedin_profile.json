    "summary": "I am currently a Clark Doctoral Fellow and Ph.D. student in Reliability Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research in the Systems Risk and Reliability Analysis (SyRRA) Lab centers around defining and modeling the concept of dependency in Human Reliability Analysis, with the ultimate goal being a quantitative model of human-machine team performance for nuclear power operations.  Prior to joining UMD, I worked as a Nuclear Test Engineer for the U.S. Department of Defense developing maintenance instructions for nuclear-cognizant components of fast-attack submarines. I have a Bachelors of Science in Nuclear and Radiological Engineering, with a minor in Mathematics from Georgia Institute of Technology. My primary fields of interest include human reliability analysis, nuclear reactor safety and accident diagnosis/prognosis. Other interests include energy policy, economics, and politics. Outside of academics, I enjoy running, reading, and cooking.",
